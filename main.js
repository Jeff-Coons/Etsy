description: "STUMP Card Game. Milton Bradley #4870 (1968), &quot;Put the Squeeze on your Opponents&quot;. Complete game and appears to have been played very little, if at all. Notice there is a small ink stain on the cover of the box (see pictures). Description from BoardGameGeek.com: &quot;The game uses a ring numbered from 1 to 40 with sliders on it. At the start, the sliders are set randomly (by card draw). On your turn, you draw a card, then play a &quot;gapper&quot; if possible (a gapper is a card falling between the numbers where the sliders rest, as indicated by the sliders&#39; arrowheads), and finally discard a card, moving a slider to the discards number. There are wild cards in the deck. If a player goes out, he wins 5 points plus one point per card still held by the other players. 25 points wins the game.&quot;",

description: "Vintage Set of 7 Pla-Mor Bing Cards with unmarked Metal Bingo Cage and yellow balls. The Bingo Cards are tan leather and are stitched together. Made by Pla-Mor. They have red plastic sliders that you slide over the number when your number is called. The metal cage is in great shape. It has a handle for spinning the wheel and a ball holder that catches a ball when the cage is rolled. Little door that opens and shuts to put the balls into the cage. Comes with yellow balls that have black bingo markings. There are a couple of cards that have some light pen marks with words or numbers on them...not that big of a deal. There are 3 number balls that are missing from the numbers on the cards. does come with some extra balls that don&#39;t match any numbers on the cards...could be used in replacement of the 3 that are missing. This item will ship out via FedEx Ground insured with tracking (within 3 days of receiving payment)",

policy_shipping: "Most items will be shipped out via FedEx Ground Insured within 3 days of payment. Furniture and large items will be shipped via TSC Moving Co (blanket wrap shipping). By using TSC Moving Co, this allows me to charge a much more affordable shipping fee unlike most freight companies that charge a fortune to ship large and heavy items. TSC Moving could take anywhere from 2-8 weeks for delivery. Once the item is paid for, I will schedule a pick up with TSC and then they will get back to me (usually within 2 days) and give me a pick up date. Once the item is picked up by TSC, you can go online with your provided tracking number and follow the progress. They will then also give an estimated delivery date. Sometimes the delivery date can change by a couple days or so. But, TSC will contact you via email to make sure the delivery date and time will work for you. If you are in a hurry to get your large item, please contact me and I can arrange for a shipping quote with a freight company that can get it to you quicker. Please note that the shipping fee will most likely be much higher than TSC. For damaged items - via FEDEX - please let me know if your item arrives damaged within 3 days of receiving it. I will then need to file a claim through the shipping company that was used to ship your package. I will refund your money, once the claim is approved. Claim approvals typically take 1-2 weeks. I will need a couple pictures of the damaged item to submit for the claim process and I will need you to keep all packaging materials (including the box it was shipped in) and the damaged item, in case the shipping company needs to see it for themselves. Once the claim is approved, you may do as you wish with all the packing materials and the damaged item. For damaged items - via TSC MOVING CO - you will need to reject the item with the delivery driver and let them know that the item is damaged. If you accept the damaged item, then there will be no refund. ",
policy_refunds: "Please chose your items carefully because I do not accept returns. I try to be very thorough in my description about the condition of the item so that there are no surprises when the item arrives. For damaged items - via FEDEX - please let me know if your item arrives damaged within 3 days of receiving it. I will then need to file a claim through the shipping company that was used to ship your package. I will refund your money, once the claim is approved. Claim approvals typically take 1-2 weeks.

title: "Place Value Pool Printable Math Game and Skill Sheet",
description: "Concept: place value of ones, tens, and hundreds Game Type: board game for 2-4 players Includes: game board, 12 number cards, rules, instructions, and a bonus skill sheet As adults we take for granted that the digit three in the number 342 stands for three hundreds. It seems so simple! But in actuality our number system is sophisticated and the product of thousands of years of human thinking. It is crucial that children understand that a digit’s worth depends on its placement in a number. Without a firm grasp of place value, higher math like multi-digit subtraction, multiplication, and decimals become meaningless. This game is designed to help children practice recognizing ones, tens, or hundreds in two and three-digit numbers. This would be appropriate to play after children have had several experiences developing the concept of place-value. In my classroom, I’ve found it to be a good review for quicker learners and a helpful support for my strugglers. In this game, players race to get their marker around the board. The first player draws a card, rolls the dice, and moves to the appropriate square. Then he answers the question on his square. If his number card is 734 and he lands on the square that says, &quot;How many ones are in your number?&quot; the correct answer is &quot;4.&quot; If he answers correctly, he stays on the square. If he answers incorrectly, he moves back to the space he was on previously. The first player to dive into the pool at the end of the board is the winner. This game includes a game board and 12 number cards. Also included are rules for play and instructions for turning the game into a file folder game. As an extra bonus, Place Value Pool includes a special skill sheet to give your student extra practice with place value. You may print as many sets as your family or class requires, but please don’t make copies to share with others. Laminating your game will help it last longer. Keep in mind that each printer is different and the colors your printer uses may vary slightly from what you see on our photos or the files.",

title: "Magic Lamp Printable Game and Skill Sheet",
description: "Concept: hard and soft C and G Game Type: board game for partners Includes: game board, 25 word cards, rules, instructions, and a bonus skill sheet (also included are an advanced set of word cards and an advanced skill sheet) Those tricky letter Cs and Gs! How can you be sure what sound they’re supposed to make?? It’s important to teach children the rules about when C sounds like an S or when G sounds like a J. Rules, however, mean nothing without a context to attach them to. That’s why playing learning games is such a helpful learning tool. It provides a fun and social setting for practicing boring rules. This game is designed to help children practice the different sounds for C and G. A C that sounds like a K, and a G that sounds like a G are referred to as “hard” sounds. Letter Cs with the S sound and Gs with the J are “soft.” Pointing out the vowels that make the consonant hard or soft will help solidify the concept for your learners. In this game, pairs of students race to get their game pieces to the top of the board. The first player to reach the top gets to make a wish on the magic lamp! This game includes a game board and 25 word cards. The words were specifically selected as words most children were likely to be familiar with. You may need to help read a few of the longer words (like “certain”) the first time the game is played. Also included are rules for play and instructions for turning the game into a file folder game. Magic Lamp includes a special skill sheet to give your student extra practice with hard and soft sounds. As an EXTRA BONUS, we also included an advanced set of word cards and an advanced skill sheet. After downloading and printing the file, it will be quick and easy to prepare this game for use. You may print as many sets as your family or class requires, but please don’t make copies to share with others. Laminating your game will help it last longer. Keep in mind that each printer is different and the colors your printer uses may vary slightly from what you see on our photos or the files.",
